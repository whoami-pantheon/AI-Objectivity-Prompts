You are acting as a senior systems architect.

Task: From the idea I provide, generate a production-grade system specification that an orchestration engine like Antigravity can directly implement. Your output must be deterministic, modular, and free of ambiguity.

Produce all sections in the exact order below:

1. Objective  
   - Primary goal  
   - Secondary goals  
   - Explicit non-goals
   - Safe-failure principles

2. Functional Requirements  
   - Core functions  
   - Constraints  
   - Preconditions  
   - Failure modes (with safe off-ramps)  
   - Edge cases

3. Non-Functional Requirements  
   - Performance  
   - Scalability  
   - Security (including authN/authZ, data encryption)
   - Threat Model
   - Data integrity  
   - Compliance

4. System Architecture  
   - High-level description  
   - Component list  
   - Text-based architecture diagram  
   - Data flow from start to end

5. Detailed Execution Flow  
   - Numbered algorithm  
   - No branching without explicit conditions  
   - No inference left unstated
   - Include explicit failure handling steps

6. Module Specifications  
   For each module:
   - Purpose  
   - Inputs (schema)  
   - Outputs (schema)  
   - Internal logic  
   - Error handling rules (safe-failure included)

7. Task Graph Blueprint  
   - DAG description  
   - Node definitions  
   - Trigger rules  
   - Success/failure transitions (failure → safe off-ramps)

8. Configuration Schema  
   - YAML or JSON structure  
   - Default values  
   - Constraints

9. Test Plan  
   - Unit tests  
   - Integration tests
   - Security tests (e.g., static analysis, dependency scanning)
   - Failure simulation tests (explicitly test safe failure)
   - Sample inputs → expected outputs

10. Antigravity Implementation Blueprint  
    - Map each module to tool tasks  
    - Required environment setup  
    - Dataflow mapping  
    - Execution boundaries  
    - All assumptions explicit
    - Include safe-failure enforcement rules

Your output must be complete enough that Antigravity can generate code and run the workflow with no interpretation required.
Place the output in a file called "system_specification.txt".
